```

🟢 PHASE 1 — Before Anything Exists

 Who is the user?

 What do they fear?

 What must they understand?

 What must NOT happen?

 What will change later?

If you can’t answer these, stop.

🟢 PHASE 2 — Product Spine (Non-Negotiable)

 One-sentence problem definition

 One primary user action

 One emotional outcome

 Explicit non-goals

This prevents AI over-design.

🟢 PHASE 3 — Design Intent Lock

 Typography rules

 Color semantics (not colors)

 Spacing system

 Motion philosophy

 Forbidden styles

Once locked, do not argue with code.

🟢 PHASE 4 — AI-Assisted Build (Layered)

 Layout only

 Typography & spacing

 Components

 State & logic

 Motion

 Accessibility

 Error & empty states

Never generate everything at once.

🟢 PHASE 5 — Human Curation Pass (Mandatory)

 Remove 30–40% of UI

 Reduce animation intensity

 Break symmetry

 Rewrite copy manually

 Simplify component APIs

This is where “AI smell” disappears.

🟢 PHASE 6 — Debug & Future-Proofing

 Can I find bugs fast?

 Is state ownership clear?

 Are components replaceable?

 Are assumptions documented?

If future-you would curse you, fix it now.
